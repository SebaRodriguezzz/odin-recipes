            <li>Eggs (6 per tortilla)</li>
            <li>Potatoes (1kg per tortilla)</li>
            <li>Onions (3 per tortilla)</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Cook ingredients</h3>
                <p>Heat oil in a pan over medium high heat, add potatoes and onions to cook, mixing the pan until the potato and onion are soft and not brown for 20 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Beating eggs</h3>
                <p>Beat 6 eggs into a large bowl until they turn a yellow pale colour, mix the onion and potatoes with a spoon to the beaten eggs and leave the oil in the pan.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Add mixture</h3>
                <p>Put another tbsp of oil into the pan with the other oil from the previous cook of onion and potato.</p>
                <p>Add the egg mixture, spreading the potatoes evenly in the pan in the egg mixture. Cook until the bottom of the tortilla is a light brown.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Turn!</h3>
                <p>Gently shake pan so the tortilla doesn't stick, then slide a spatula gently along the edges and underneath the tortilla. 
                    Place a large plate over pan and quickly turn plate and pan over so the tortilla will fall onto plate.</p>
                <p>Add 1 to the pan and slide the tortilla back in carefully tuck in sides with a fork, and continue cooking over medium heat until eggs are just set, about 3 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
