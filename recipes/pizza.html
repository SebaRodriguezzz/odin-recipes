        <p>Homemade pizza is easy, inexpensive, and delicious. All you need is a few basic ingredients and baking implements.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups white flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Toppings</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Dough Preparation</h3>
                <p>In a small bowl add 1 1/2 cups of warm water. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of yeast on the water and stir to dissolve. Set aside for about 10 minutes until the yeast starts forming bubbles.</p>
                <p>Add 3 1/2 cups of white flour to a large bowl and shape to allow a depression in the center</p>
                <p>Once yeast is ready, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt, then pour into the large bowl with the flour. The depression you made should contain it momentarily.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Dough Forming</h3>
                <p>Stir the yeast mixture into the dough. Once somewhat mixed, knead with your hands. It may seem dry initially, but as you continue to knead it should become more sticky.
                    Once well worked, form it into a ball.</p>
                <p>Grease a medium-sized bowl with olive oil and set your dough ball inside. Score the top of the ball to allow for expansion.</p>
                <p>Cover with a towel (you might want to dampen it slightly) and set aside for about an hour to rise. Someplace warm is best.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Dough Finishing</h3>
                <p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and remove from bowl.</p>
                <p>Form into a elongated shape, then cut into pieces. Cutting into quarters will result in 4 approximately 8" pizzas.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rolling, Rolling, Rolling...</h3>
                <p>Spread a light coat of flour on your cutting board and rolling pin.</p>    
                <p>Take one of your dough lumps, center it on the board, and start rolling it out. The thickness is a personal preference. 
                    If your dough gets out of circular shape, tuck the offending section back in, and continue rolling.</p>
                <p>Once you're happy with the thickness and shape, fold the edges over to form the crust. Press with your fingers to secure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Sauce and Toppings</h3>
                <p>This is where things start to pay off. Spread some pizza sauce, either canned which works just fine, or make your own.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella cheese, add your choice of toppings, and sprinkle a little more cheese.</p>
                <p>Transfer to a flat baking pan. Pizza pans with holes work well (Actually, you might want to do this first, it can be messy once loaded-up with sauce and toppings).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Baking</h3>
                <p>Bake your pizza at around 400F degrees until the cheese starts to bubble and brown.</p>
                <p>Remove from oven. Let sit for a couple of minutes before cutting into slices to allow the melted cheese to solidify a little.</p>
                <p>Bask in the aroma of freshly baked pizza, then serve with your beverage of choice.</p>
